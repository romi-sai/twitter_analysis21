# Analyzing the Social Networks of Twitter users during COVID
Research work done during an Independent Study under Dr. Kenneth Joseph

This repository consists of code to analyze twitter's users' social networks during the recent pandemic. 
The objective of this code is to analyze the connection times of a user's followees (people a user follows) to then analyze how many of 
the connections were made post 2020 due to the pandemic breaking out in 2020. This code generates a scatterplot, and each point on the scatterplot 
represents the number of people the particular user has followed since 2020 (01-01-2020).
